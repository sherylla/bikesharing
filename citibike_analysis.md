# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.

Population
Des Moines population is about 2.3% of New Yorks population in 2018. However, they have relative percentage in age and gender:

### Female
NYC: 52.3%
DM: 50.8%

### Age
Under 5 in NYC: 6.5%
Under 5 in DM: 6.9%
Under 18 in NYC: 20.9%
Under 18 in DM: 24.5%
Over 65 in NYC: 14.1%
Over 65 in DM: 11.7%

Based on these numbers, we are not expecting a lot of annual subscribers. However, there are a couple of opportunities that we can explore:

### State Fairs
In 2019, over 1.1 million visitors travel to Iowa State Fair, with 40K more visitors compared to 2018.

### Des Moines Bike tours
In 2016, Des Moines generated over 13M visitors, which creates opportunities for bike sharing programs that will enable visitors to visit public gardens, distilleries, downtown architectures, and many more.
